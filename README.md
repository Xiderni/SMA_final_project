# Framing the Race: Strategic Game Framing and Media attributed Polarization in the 2024 French Snap Elections

A research project for Social Media Analysis By Elina Baudier, Raphaël Caille,  Davide Ciuffini

# Introduction

France's 2024 snap legislative elections garnered significant national and worldwide attention due to the rarity of the event, the risks at play and it's sudden 
announcement that resulted in heightened political polarisation. The elections, which were prompted by President Emmanuel Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly, became the primary topic of contention in the nation's political climate, with competing perspectives erupting across all ideological parties (Chabal & Behrent, 2024).The election was a crucial turning point in modern French politics, a the election mainly revealed the increasing prominence of both far-left and far-right groups, particularly the newly formed Nouveau Front Populaire created to combat the extremism and dominance of the Rassemblement National (Ivaldi, 2024).  Given the topic's importance to both political science and media studies, our group has decided to study how French national media outlets from an array of political orientations framed the 2024 snap elections, paying particular attention to the popular use of strategic game framing.
The selected time period ranging from June 9 to July 7, 2024 was used for a number of reasons: it encompasses the entire duration of the snap election campaign, from the dissolution of the French National Assembly to the last round of voting; it represents a period of high political importance, allowing for the identification of framing usage during highly consequential electoral pressure; and it offers a targeted timeframe where media narratives are likely to be most concentrated and politically relevant.
The media outlets included for this study span a broad range of ideologies and were picked because of their national significance, their ability to shape political discourse, and the variety of content types they provide.
Libération, Le Nouvel Obs, L'Humanité, and Marianne were picked to represent the left-leaning media outlets. Le Monde, La Tribune du Dimanche, La Croix, and 20 Minutes were the examples for center-leaning media. And finally  Valeurs Actuelles, Le Figaro, L'Express, and Le Point for right-leaning.  These publications offer a thorough and representative cross-section of French political journalism during the election season through publishing frequently, and in a variety of formats, including news reports, analysis pieces, interviews, editorials, features, and profiles, in addition to having varying editorial stances.  They are essential to our inquiry because of their impact on public debate and because of their large audience, which guarantees that the framing techniques used represent the mainstream media landscape (Lecheler & De Vreese, 2012).
Our study seeks to provide understanding on the connection between ideological polarisation and political media framing, specifically in the modern French environment.  We aim to analyse how strategic game framing, which prioritises focus on competition and electoral manoeuvring over substantive policy focus, may have influenced voter perceptions and the larger political narrative by concentrating on well-known national media outlets with distinct editorial identities.  Through doing this, we can identify the potential biases present in these outlets' reporting approaches as well as their persuasive power.

# Literature Review

The term "strategic gameframing" describes the shift in political news coverage from issue-oriented reporting to coverage that primarily focuses on competition and political strategies (Schmuck et al. 2017,2). Many scholars throughout the world have raised concerns about this ongoing trend, especially in view of the possible threats that strategic game framing poses to modern democratic practices (Schmuck et al. 2017,2). Strategic game framing is a common political journalism technique that has sparked debate about its potential effects on democratic engagement and public confidence in politics.  By emphasising the competitive aspects of politics, such as horse race analogies, strategic moves, and election success, rather than meaningful policy discussions or ideological arguments, this framing usually turns voters into passive, cynical onlookers (Shehata 2014, 157).  Such coverage, which emphasises conflict, drama, and controversy, demobilises the electorate by fostering mistrust and disengagement from the democratic process (Shehata 2014, 159).  Strategic news frames have the potential to erode public confidence in political actors and promote scepticism by portraying politicians as self-serving and untrustworthy (Shehata 2014, 159). Meanwhile, it has been shown that issue-framed journalism reduces these negative effects by fostering institutional trust and political interest (Shehata 2014, 172). Journalists must therefore carefully combine strategic and substantive framing to avoid escalating public mistrust and to encourage an informed, engaged electorate (Shehata 2014, 174).  Competitive game-frames have the potential to increase cynicism, which could contribute to ideological polarisation and in turn undermine democracy. The formation of strategic game framing is significantly influenced by French media, especially the most widely used news outlets.  This study will look at how these frames are employed during important and highly mediated elections and how they may affect voters' perceptions of the political climate in France.  This study's emphasis on how the media presents political contests will offer important new insights into the dynamics of political communication and how it affects public opinion and election results. This is particularly relevant in France since the country's political instability is symbolised by the radical left and radical right parties' increasing popularity and attention in French elections, have gradually begun to resemble the infamous ideological divide of the US two-party system (Ivaldi 2024, 175). Due to their representation and escalation of the nation's political divide and contribution to the rise of far-right and far-left populism in France, the 2024 French parliamentary elections were higly remarkable. They were an after-affect and result of the social unrest, economic unrest, and dissatisfaction with President Emmanuel Macron's administration (Ivaldi 2024, 165). These, together with concerns over immigration and economic instability, helped Marine Le Pen's Rassemblement National (RN) achieve an impressive first-round performance. Nevertheless, in the emergency election Macron convened following the European Parliament elections, the far-right failed to secure the absolute majority it had planned for. The RN ended up with 143 seats, a significant rise than its 2022 total, while however not forming a majority government (Ivaldi 2024, 174). It was believed that Macron's sudden decision to dissolve the National Assembly and organise a snap election was a deliberate gamble intended to make voters and political parties confront the possibility of an RN parliamentary majority (Chabal and Behrent 2024, 332). This move brought together the Nouveau Front Populaire, a coalition of leftist organisations that have traditionally fought the far-right. The left achieved surprising success under the guise of the newly formed NFP, winning against RN in pivotal final elections (Chabal and Behrent 2024, 333).

However, the elections symbolised a return to France's popularity and dominance of extremist political groups. France's struggle against the extreme right is linked to worldwide anti-authoritarian movements and reflects broader global trends through this political conflict. With no chosen prime minister and a hung parliament split into three ideological blocs, the election ultimately left France in a political deadlock. This impasse underlines how growing polarisation and widening societal divisions present challenges to the democratic process.
Given that political communication is increasingly seen as a critical element in influencing how the public views elections, the study remains pertinent (Lecheler and De Vreese 2012, 186).  In an age of increasing media influence, recognising how media outlets portray elections as strategic competitions will help define how political journalism influences voter turnout and election results.  By using strategic game frame theory to analyse the French snap elections, this work will contribute to the development of new understandings into how media frames may affect election outcomes and intensify existing political polarisation.


# II) Methodology

## II.A) Extraction and pre-processing

First of all, we collected on Factiva all the articles from 09/06/2024 to 07/07/2024 containing at least once the word "legislative election".
These articles come from newspapers with three political orientations:
  
  •	From the center: Le Monde (daily), La Tribune du Dimanche (weekly), La Croix, (daily), 20 Minutes (daily): **a total of 679 articles**
  
  •	From left: Libération (daily), Le Nouvel Obs (weekly), L'Humanité (daily), Marianne (weekly): **127 articles in total**
  
  •	From the right: Le Figaro (daily), Le Point (weekly), Valeurs Actuelles (weekly), L'Express (weekly): **202 articles in total**

From Factiva we extract PDF files of all the articles, a first notebook codes_data_ formating.ipynb allows us to convert these PDFs of several hundred articles into CSV files, by political orientation and by round (T1 for first round of elections, T2 for second round). They are available in the **SMA_final_project /data/ data_articles** folder and are named: articles_extraits_T1_centre.csv, articles_extraits_T2_centre.csv, articles_extraits_T1_droite.csv, articles_extraits_T2_droite.csv, articles_extraits_T1_gauche.csv, articles_extraits_T2_gauche.csv.

**Part A) Data import and small pre-processing** of the notebook **article_analysis.ipynb** allows you to bring these files together in a single dataframe while adding two columns, the political orientation and the type of newspaper (daily/weekly). This is also an opportunity to do a pre-processing to remove the few parasitic lines (name of the newspaper, date of extraction, article identifier) due to the presentation format of the articles on Factiva)

## II.B) TOP 500 adjectives and nouns and classification

For each political orientation, in part **B) Word Count**, we use *spaCy* and the *fr_core_news_sm model* to extract the list of most used nouns and adjectives. For each political orientation, we create a csv with the list of the 500 most common nouns and 500 adjectives. We then manually assign each word the classification **'Issue Based ' (IB)** or **'Horse based ' (HR)**, we put nothing if it does not correspond to any category, which is regular.
The classified tables can be viewed on GitHub in the **data/TOP 500** repertory
In total we have: **142 IB nouns** against **101 HR nouns**, and **222 IB adjectives** against **97 HR adjectives**. The rest are classified as neutral.

## II.C) Topic modeling

*gensim.models* library that we run on the corpus of articles from left-leaning newspapers, articles from right-leaning newspapers, and centrist newspapers. We also run the algorithm on all articles from daily newspapers and all articles from weeklies. The results will then be analyzed.
The code for this step is in part **D) Topic analysis** . Here are the parameters we use for our LDA:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0d440703-b7e1-4ed6-9779-cd3355270720)

 
This subject analysis is an interesting interlude in our work

## II.D) Classifying articles

Next, we seek to assign each article a score of either "Horse Race" (HR) or "Issue- Based " (IB) . To do this, we analyze all the words in the article to identify those that appear in our lists of nouns or adjectives previously classified as HR or IB. For example, if the word "survey ," classified as HR, appears three times in an article, the article is awarded three points for this term.
Each article thus obtains four distinct scores:
 
  •	A score named IB ,
  
  •	A score named HR ,
  
  •	adjective score IB ,
  
  •	HR adjective score .
  
In order to compensate for the imbalance between the number of terms classified in each category (142 IB nouns against 101 HR nouns, and 222 IB adjectives against 97 HR adjectives), we apply correction factors :
  
  •	The score of HR names is multiplied by 142/101 ,
  
  •	That of HR adjectives by 222/97 .
  
By summing the corrected noun and adjective scores, we obtain the overall HR and IB scores for each article. These scores are then normalized by dividing them by the total number of words in the article, to avoid a long article automatically having a higher score than a short one.

Finally, we calculate the HR/IB ratio . A ratio greater than 1 indicates that the article is more Horse Race oriented , while a ratio less than 1 suggests an Issue- Based orientation .

For each political orientation, we generate an intermediate CSV in which, per article, we have the list of IB words, the list of HR words, the list of IB adjectives and the list of HR adjectives. These files are named: **df_centre_IB_HR_ranked.csv** , **df_centre_IB_HR_ranked.csv** , **df_centre_IB_HR_ranked.csv** and are accessible on GitHub in the **data/ IB_HR_rank** directory

The code for this processing can be found in section **E.1 – Calculating IB and HR scores** of the notebook.

## II.E) Plotting curves

We can derive some statistics from the score given to each article.
 
However, we prefer visualization in the form of curves, which allows us to more intuitively follow the evolution of scores over the electoral period.
this , we use the pandas groupby function to group the data by day and political orientation. This reduces the number of rows in the dataframe by calculating the average of the scores for each group. For example, the row corresponding to 06/18/2024 - left will represent the average of the scores of all articles published that day in left-leaning newspapers. The code used to perform this temporal and political grouping, as well as to generate the associated curves, can be found in section **E.2 – Graphs of IB/HR scores** of the notebook .

In a second step, we analyze the scores according to the rhythm of publication of the newspapers, this time grouping the articles according to whether they come from daily or weekly newspapers , while maintaining the same averaging logic. The code corresponding to this processing can be found in section **E.3 – Graphs by rhythm of publication** .

We plotted a week where each point represents a week to achieve a smoothing effect. A daily plot would be too sensitive to variations in the number of publications each day, making the data too unstable. Furthermore, while a daily frequency can be considered for articles from the center, which has several thousand, it is not suitable for the extreme left or right, where there are only a few hundred articles over the entire period.

All results and figures produced are available in the results repertory **SMA_final_project/Results/**


# III) Results
As previously explained, in our analysis we decided to extract the most common 500 adjectives and nouns, divided between HR (horse race) and IB (issue based) terms. The most common HR nouns were "pourcent", "élection" and "juin". The most common IB nours were "euro", "programme" and "marché". 
The most common HR adjectives were "politique", "gauche" and "éxecutif", with "politique" being by large the most common one (around 10 times more used than "gauche"). As per IB adjectives, the most used were "européen", "public" and "social".
A much greater variety in HR nouns and adjectives can be noted, given the much higher usage of such terms in media during the month of June 2024.

After having calculated the corrected HR and IB scores of the nouns and adjectives, we normalize them by dividing them by the total number of words in the article, to avoid a long article automatically having a higher score than a short one. With the data obtained, we calculate the HR/IB ratio and we trace the evolution of the score in the election period visualized as curves for left wing, right wing and centre-aligned media. 

![evolution_IB_HR](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a677c682-4955-46f7-91c1-59b43dd09213)

![Average IB HR by political orientation](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/03bf0dfa-73c5-4a14-a625-c78cc69d5f7a)

From the obtained representation we notice a consistent predilection for HR terms in the case of left wing, right wing and centre-aligned media. Centre-aligned media lead the table for what concerns the usage of both HR and IB terms. The average HR/IR ratio indicates a prevalence of HR oriented articles and this ratio is more present . 

On topics analysis, we get the same issue.

![CENTRE_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a3894f6a-c58b-4244-a963-f4c5cb59d83d)

For centre topic analysis above, we get 5 Horse Race topics (Topic 3, Topic 6, Topic 8, Topic 9 and Topic 10) against 4 IB topics (2,4,7,12)

![DROITE_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/79419f74-e387-4ca3-a68f-dd1b5ed73cab)

For right wing topics analysis above, 5 HR Topics (2, 6, 7, 8 and 12) but 6 Issue Based Topics (1, 3, 5, 9, 10, 11)

![GAUCHE_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32e9d908-9b94-4634-869e-78b517ee43c5)

For left wing topics analysis above, We get 8 Horse Race topics (2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11, 12) and we get three issue based topics (1, 5, 7)


These topic analysis results are coherent with the first analysis, right-wing news paper tends to publish less Horse Race articles than centre and left (which used the more), even if the diffenrences are small.


However, great differences between newspapers can be noticed. It could be possible to argue that the HR/IB usage difference depends more on the newspapers themselves and their style of reporting than on the media alignment. Daily newspapers favour HR terms, as opposed to weekly releases (visible in **Results/Ratio HR on IB by newspaper**).  

The ratio score HR / score IB is 2.56 for daily newspaper against 2.23 for hebdomadary news paper. This difference is also visible with the topic analysis on daily articles and weekly ones.

![DAILY_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d4fdfc8-4b41-46e5-b4d1-ae5d82050d5c)

Here, from the figure above, we can classify 7 topics as "Horse Race" (Topic 2, Topic 3, Topic 6, Topic 9, Topic 10, Topic 11 and Topic 12) and 4 as "Issue Based" (Topic 4, Topic 5, Topic 7 and Topic 8).

For weekly articles, here is the topics extraction :

![WEEKLY_12](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ccb6eeb4-1d51-4180-b137-71d3ecc0cc62)

We get only 4 Horse Race subjects (Topic 5, 8, 10, 11) and 8 Issue Based topics ( Topic 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 12)

**In conclusion, it seems that newspapers favor horse race articles, a trend more marked in dailies than weeklies. From a political point of view, this type of article is used more by left-wing newspapers, followed by centrists and then right-wing papers. These observations are reinforced by topic analysis.**

**However, this conclusion needs to be qualified. Our corpus includes a majority of weeklies among right-wing newspapers, which are more likely to publish issue-based articles. This creates a structural bias. Ideally, we should have had an equivalent number of articles from dailies and weeklies for each political orientation (left, center, right). Factiva was unable to achieve this balanced distribution, as the platform contains far more right-wing weeklies than right-wing dailies - an imbalance that is less prevalent for centrist and left-wing newspapers. Attempting to impose strict parity between newspaper types and orientations would have reduced the sample size to the point of compromising the analysis.**
